## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#192A56) for a professional and trustworthy feel.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F4F8), nearly white, to keep a clean and professional aesthetic.
- Accent color: Light orange (#E58E26) for CTAs and important links, to draw attention without clashing with the overall blue tone.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for a modern, clean, and highly readable style, especially suitable for a professional website.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font. Pairing with Inter, this choice helps create some subtle contrast and add a contemporary scientific look.
- Use minimalist, outline-style icons in dark blue (#192A56) to complement the clean design.
- Employ a grid-based layout with ample spacing to create a clean and organized presentation, similar to Vaidban.
- Subtle fade-in animations for page transitions to enhance user experience without being distracting.
